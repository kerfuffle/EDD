# EDD (Official Name in the Works)
Project for EDD (Engineering Design and Development). Will consist of a low level communications system designed specifically for hospital patients who have trouble communicating.

The idea of this project is based around a hospital patient's limited mobility, infringing on their ability to communicate. The project will receive input via sensors located on the patient's fingers (and possibly arms). Simple finger motion will relay a signal to a RaspberryPi, which in turn will process and, using Java's amazing datagram, relay the motion to the patient's smart phone or tablet so that he/she may keep track of letter's toggled and words created. Different configurations will be available, the most basic one being left/right index finger to move the selected letter left/right and perhaps both to enter. Friends and family will be able to join a "chatroom" through their smart phone/tablet/computer so that they may view the patient's words as well.

This repository will mainly be used for the networking side of this project.
