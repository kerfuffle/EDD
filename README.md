# Communication Band
Will consist of a low level communications system designed specifically for hospital patients who have trouble communicating.

The idea of this project is based around a hospital patient's limited mobility, infringing on their ability to communicate. The project will receive input via vibration sensors located on the patient's fingers. Simple finger motion will relay a signal to a RaspberryPi, which in turn will process and relay the motion to the patient's smart phone/tablet/computer (any device that can be mounted within eyesight) so that he/she may keep track of letter's toggled and words created. Different configurations will be available, the most basic using the left/right pointer finger to move the selected letter left/right and both to enter. Friends and family will be able to join a "chatroom" through their smart phone/tablet/computer so that they may view the patient's words as well.

This repository will mainly be used for the networking side of this project.
